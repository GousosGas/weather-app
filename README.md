# Weather app

## Project Description

The Web application was developed using React, TypeScript, Mantine 7, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.
The application leverages the Atomic Design Pattern for structuring components, promoting reusability and scalability.
Mantine provided robust UI components, while Tailwind CSS facilitated efficient styling with its utility-first approach.
Vite's fast build process streamlined development. This combination of technologies and design principles ensured a modular, maintainable, and performant application,
aligning with modern front-end development standards.
